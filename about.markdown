## I'm Hayavadhan, Product designer from Chennai ##

I'm a Certified Usability Analyst from HFI. I graduated from University of Madras with a degree in physics, and an MBA in marketing.

My most recent work at Jargon Handlers was designing the interface for a voice recongnition app. My previous experience working for an advertising agency and currently leading a  team of designers & developers taught me how to balance business goals & engineering constraints while advocating for user goals.

 I'm interested in front-end development and Javascript. I draw and make art to communicate ideas and I'm inspired by travelling, meeting people from various cultures.
I'm also interested in photography with which I can tell stories visually.
