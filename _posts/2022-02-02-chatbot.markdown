## Introduction

## Role
- Conducted brainstorming sessions with developers to sketch wireframes 
- Created a low fidelity interactive prototype with google slides to test interactions.
- Facilitated usability testing on red routes and make corrections on critical user tasks before the development cycle.
- Designed interface and high fidelity prototype using Adobe XD.

## Challenges
- Providing an alternative user interface to conventional flowchart model for creating conversations.
- Creating chatbot themes

## Solution
Users of competitor chatbot builders found it difficult to create conversations with conventional UI using flowcharts.

After extensive brainstorming sessions with developers I quickly sketched wireframes and created a low fidelity interactive prototype with google slides. 
This was done in order to facilitate usability testing on red routes and make corrections on critical user tasks before the development cycle. I designed a WYSIWYG chatbot builder that is easy to use and provided a live preview of how the chat bot would look.

## Results
We started our project to come up with a MVP for the launch, but we ended up creating a polished version of the app that delivered itâ€™s promised purpose.

We now have over 3000 global users creating chatbots for the websites.

PS: With feedback from our customers, I designed interface for new features like multiple language support, animated backgrounds, Split-test features and more.
